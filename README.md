# 🐳 Containerized Local LLM Grounding Engine

A dual-pipeline, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system engineered to provide highly accurate, document-grounded answers from private policy documents. This project demonstrates proficiency in orchestrating a hybrid architecture combining cloud-based and self-hosted embedding models with Dockerized vector and data persistence services.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository showcases a robust solution for querying private knowledge bases (specifically, Kerala Government policy documents).  
The core technical achievement is the implementation of **two parallel RAG pipelines**:

### **1. Cloud-Powered Pipeline**
- Uses **Google’s Gemini embedding model** for vector creation.

### **2. Self-Hosted Pipeline**
- Utilizes **Xenova/transformers** to run a lightweight local Sentence Transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), providing a cost-effective and low-latency alternative.

All essential services—vector store, database, and cache—are managed and persisted using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

---

## ⭐ Key Features

- **Dual-Embedding RAG**: Fully functional Cloud API and Local Embedding pipelines.
- **Local Embedding Generation**: Runs Xenova models locally—no external embedding API required.
- **Containerized Infrastructure**: ChromaDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis orchestrated via Docker Compose.
- **Vector Persistence**: ChromaDB uses Docker volumes to store embeddings.
- **Streaming API**: Chat responses are streamed using Next.js API routes.
